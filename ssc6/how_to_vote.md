# üì• How to vote

Fill in the form, use your voting password, Eurovision-style voting!

New in SSC6, we will use *Forms* to cast your votes each week!

We will share a voting form every week so that all SSC6 participants can cast their votes for the songs of that week.

The voting period will open every Friday at 12 p.m. UTC and end every Sunday at 12 p.m. UTC.

**Important**: Only SSC6 participants can vote. Each participant with an accepted song will receive a **voting password** that you must submit in the form to vote. Please keep your voting password secret and safe, and if you forget it, please reach out to one of the committee members.

## Points-based voting

If you‚Äôre familiar with Eurovision, this will be very familiar - ‚ÄúDouze Points!!‚Äù

For SSC6, we will use a points-based voting system. You will be able to choose which songs receive 12 points, 10 points, 8 points, and one song each for 1-7 points.

Voting results will be checked and revealed every Sunday. Each week, the top 5 songs will progress to the finals. Ties may be decided by tie-breakers

## Honor system

Suno Song Contest is about sharing your creativity and connecting with others over incredible music!

It is not about ‚Äòlikes‚Äô or ‚Äòtrending‚Äô. While we know many of us have friends in the community, please vote for the songs you like based on the music, and don‚Äôt ask your friends for votes. If you see someone asking for votes or doing something you‚Äôre uncomfortable with, please bring it to our attention.

We reserve the right to disqualify any participant based on trying to game the system or influence the voting in any way that goes against the spirit of SSC.
