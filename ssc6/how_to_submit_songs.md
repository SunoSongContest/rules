# ðŸ“© How to submit songs

Fill in the form. We will contact you for corrections and/or when your song is accepted. Then wait for the weekly reveals to learn when your song is playing!

New in SSC6, we will be using Google Forms to submit information about your songs and to vote!

**Important**: Please do <ins>NOT</ins> submit songs in the discord chat - only songs submitted through the form will be accepted.

We will ask you to fill in details about:

* Your Discord details so we know how to find you here

* Your Suno details and Song - so we know what song you are submitting

* Provide background information about your song so we can help promote it and celebrate your success when you reach the finals!

After you submit your form, we will check the songs to ensure they follow the guidelines.

If we need you to update any details in your songâ€”like correcting the song title or durationâ€”we will contact you, and you will have 24 hours to make any adjustments or resubmit another song.

After your song has been approved, you will receive a message from one of us to let you know youâ€™ve made it into SSC6!

**Important**: This message will also include your voting password, which you will need to vote each week. Keep it secret, keep it safe!

We will keep it a surprise which songs will participate in each weekâ€¦ so stay tuned for the weekly playlist reveals every Monday!
